# Git Workflow Automation Script

This Bash script streamlines the Git workflow for developers by automating several common tasks associated with setting up, maintaining, and pushing changes to a Git repository. It's designed to save time and reduce the manual steps required during project setup and version control management.

Fun Fact üòÑ

This very script was used to automate the setup of its own repository. It's a bit like sending a robot back in time to build itself. We've truly come full circle! ü§ñüîÑüòÇ

If you find this script useful and it makes your Git workflow a bit smoother, I'd deeply appreciate a star (‚≠êÔ∏è) on GitHub! It's a simple gesture that goes a long way in supporting creators like myself. Moreover, if you're keen on staying in the loop with this script's evolution and my other projects, hitting that follow button would mean the world to me. Your engagement not only fuels my passion but also shapes the future of this script. Together, let's make Git Workflow Automation even more powerful. Thank you for your support and for considering to follow my journey!

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- Git
- Node.js and npm (if your project requires them)
- GitHub CLI

### macOS Specific Requirements

- HomeBrew to install GitHub CLI

### Operating System Compatibility

This script is designed to run on Unix-like operating systems with native Bash support, such as Linux and macOS. Windows users can run the script through the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)

## Features:

- **Directory Confirmation:** Prompts the user to confirm they're working in the correct directory before proceeding with any Git operations, enhancing safety and accuracy.
- **Project Download Option:** Offers the choice to download a project using either the `tiged` (npx tiged command) or `git clone` method, facilitating easy project setup from a remote repository.
- **Automatic Repository Creation:** Allows the creation of a new GitHub repository for the current directory. It initializes the repository as private by default, streamlining the process of going from a local project to a remote repository.
- **`.gitignore` File Management:** Checks for the existence of a `.gitignore` file and offers to create one if it's missing, with a default entry to ignore `node_modules`, helping maintain a clean repository.
- **Node Modules Installation:** Detects if the `node_modules` directory exists and offers to install dependencies using `npm install` if it doesn't, ensuring project dependencies are up to date.
- **Git Initialization Check:** Verifies if the current directory is already initialized as a Git repository, and initializes one if not, ensuring that version control is set up.
- **Staging and Committing Changes:** Prompts the user to stage all changes and commit them, with options for an "Initial Commit" message or a custom message, facilitating straightforward version control management.
- **Git Status and Log Overview:** After committing, displays the current Git status and a log of commits, providing a clear overview of the repository's state.
- **Remote Origin Management:** Checks if a remote origin is set and offers to add or change it, ensuring that the local repository is correctly linked to a remote one. This step includes pushing changes to the remote repository.
- **Push Validation:** Before pushing, confirms with the user that everything looks good, adding an extra layer of verification to prevent accidental pushes.
- **Script Exit Points:** Includes multiple exit points based on user decisions or if critical steps fail (e.g., directory change, Git repository initialization), ensuring that the script does not proceed without the required setup.

## Usage:

Ensure you have Git, npm (Node Package Manager), and the GitHub CLI installed on your system before using the script. If you haven't set up an alias for the script such as `gitwf` , please refer to the installation instructions provided with this project for details on how to do so. This alias allows for easy access and execution of the script from anywhere in your terminal.

To use the script, simply type `gitwf` or the alias you setup into your terminal and press Enter while in the directory you would like your project to be downloaded or the directory of the project you want to run some of the above-mentioned functions on. Follow the interactive prompts to navigate through various Git and project setup tasks, such as confirming the current directory, downloading a project, creating a repository, managing `.gitignore`, installing node modules, initializing Git, staging and committing changes, and managing remote origins.

This script is designed to improve the efficiency of Git workflows, making it easier for developers to manage their version control tasks and project setups this may not be a perfect fit for your use case, so if you have any suggestion for improvements feel free to submit a issue, pull request and/or start a discussion. I would love to expand the functionality of this script.

## Installation

### Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)

#### Step 1: Install the GitHub CLI

First, install the GitHub CLI (`gh`) if it's not already installed on your machine. Execute the following commands in your terminal:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://cli.github.com/packages/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg | sudo dd of=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg] https://cli.github.com/packages stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/github-cli.list > /dev/null
sudo apt update
sudo apt install gh
```

#### Step 2: Authenticate with GitHub

Authenticate with your GitHub account using `gh`:

```sh
gh auth login
```

Follow the prompts to select your preferred authentication method and set the default git protocol.

### macOS Instructions

#### Step 1: Install Homebrew (if not already installed)

```sh
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

#### Step 2: Install GitHub CLI

```sh
brew install gh
```

#### Step 3: Authenticate with GitHub

```sh
gh auth login
```

Follow the prompts to select your preferred authentication method and set the default git protocol.

### General Instructions for Both WSL and macOS

#### Step 3: Obtain a Copy of the Repository

To keep your local copy of the project easily updatable as changes are made, we recommend using `git clone` to download the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/PixelHabits/git-workflow-automation.git
```

This command will create a new directory named `git-workflow-automation` that contains the entire project, including the `git_workflow.sh` script.

#### Step 4: Ensure Script Executability

After cloning the repository, ensure the `git_workflow.sh` script is executable by updating its permissions:

```sh
chmod +x /path/to/git_workflow.sh
```

**Tip for macOS users:** To easily find the path of a file or directory, you can drag and drop the file into the Terminal window.

**Reminder:** Replace `/path/to/git_workflow.sh` with the actual path to the script, which would typically be within the `git-workflow-automation` directory you've just cloned.

#### Step 5: Add an Alias for the Script

To easily run the `git_workflow.sh` script from anywhere in your terminal, add an alias to your terminal's profile file:

For Bash users:

```sh
echo "alias gitwf='bash /path/to/git_workflow.sh'" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

**Reminder:** Ensure you replace `/path/to/git_workflow.sh` with the actual full path to where you've placed the script in the `git-workflow-automation` directory.

**Note:** The alias `gitwf` in the command above can be changed to whatever you prefer, as long as it does not conflict with existing terminal commands.

For Zsh (macOS) users:

```sh
echo "alias gitwf='bash /path/to/git_workflow.sh'" >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

**Tip for macOS users:** To easily find the path of a file or directory, you can drag and drop the file into the Terminal window.

**Reminder:** Ensure you replace `/path/to/git_workflow.sh` with the actual full path to where you've placed the script in the `git-workflow-automation` directory.

**Note:** The alias `gitwf` in the command above can be changed to whatever you prefer, as long as it does not conflict with existing terminal commands.

#### Updating Your Local Copy

To update your local copy with the latest changes from the repository, navigate to the directory that contains the `git_workflow.sh` script and execute:

```sh
cd /path/to/git-workflow-automation
git pull
```

**Reminder:** Replace `/path/to/git-workflow-automation` with the actual path to the directory. This step ensures you're in the correct location to update your local repository with any new changes.

**Tip for macOS users:** To easily find the path of a file or directory, you can drag and drop the file into the Terminal window.
